# ML Implementations

## About
This is yet another repo of Python implementations for several Machine Learning models from scratch. These implementations are by no means the best or most elegant, but are a learning opportunity to understand them in-depth and present them in a concise and understandable manner.

This is a work in progress and will be occasionally updated with more implementations and fixes. The current plan is laid out in the [implementations](#implementations) section.
